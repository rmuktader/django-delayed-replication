The archive contains docker-compose configuration for Django sample
application and PostgreSQL replicated database.

This app is put together using the Bitnami Postgres image (https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-postgresql).The reason for using this image is the fact that replication is tricky to get working automatically in every case. Bitnami has replication features baked in and has more than 1K of lines of code covering many edge cases of replication (https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-postgresql/blob/master/10/debian-10/rootfs/opt/bitnami/scripts/libpostgresql.sh). They still have bugs. Yet, it is the most solid implementation of Docker Postgres implementation out there right now. It would not be possible to build such a robust replication stack from scratch. There are articles on the internet that show how to build replication stack but they also have many complaints associated with them. At best they are of "works on my machine" quality.

Change into the directory with 'docker-compose.yml' file and run 'docker-compose build'.

After the build run 'docker-compose up'. It will bring the DB and the
application up. For the first time it takes about a minute to initialize DB.

After starting the stack for the first time you need run migrations with
following command:

docker-compose run web /code/manage.py migrate

The test Django applicaiton is accessible at the http://localhost:8000/.

To verify the delay between PostgreSQL master and slave run following command:

docker-compose exec postgresql-master ping postgresql-slave

There is a test code in test/views.py to demonstrate read-after-write
inconsistency which can be triggered by visiting http://localhost:8000/test/

The test code creates a test record with ID=1 and strores current timestamp in
the record's text field and writes this record into the DB and then
immediatelly tries to read the record with the same ID=1 back and check the
timestamp from the that record. The test code also reports the replication lag
as reported by the slave DB itself but this can be imprecise as it reports the
time since the last communication with the master DB so if there was no
records written/updated then the lag will be reported as very large. For
better results you need to refresh the /test/ page multiple times.

The DB lag is implemented by forcing network delay between master and slave
and currently set to 1000ms = 1s. Actual replication lag will be a little
bit higher than network delay. The network delay can be adjusted by modifying
DELAY_MS variable in postgresql/add-delay-to-slave.sh script and rebuilding
all images with 'docker-composer build' and restarting all containers.

To use this stack with existing project you can either copy the docker related
files to your project directory or copy your project files to this directory.

The list of the docker files needed:
docker-compose.yml
Dockerfile
entrypoint.sh
postgresql/*

You will need to check and adjust your application DB configuration in
routers.py and settings.py
